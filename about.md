# About the Workshop

Welcome to the **qStack: International Workshop on Quantum Systems**. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners to discuss the future of quantum computing stacks, from hardware to software and applications. We aim to bridge the gap between diverse disciplines—including computer architecture, high-performance computing (HPC), operating systems, and programming languages—uniting them under a shared community dedicated to advancing quantum computing.

## Overview
As quantum hardware scales up, the software stack becomes increasingly critical. This workshop aims to explore:
- Quantum Operating Systems
- Quantum Cloud Orchestration
- High-Performance Computing (HPC) Integration and Hybrid Systems
- Compilers, Programming Languages, and Formal Verification for Quantum Computing
- Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) and Quantum Error Correction (QEC)
- Micro-architectures and Real-time Quantum Control
- Quantum Architecture Design 

We invite submissions and participation from the entire community.

## Call for Participation
We are looking for posters and talks! Please see the [Registration](#registration) section for more details.
